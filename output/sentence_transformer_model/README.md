- source_sentence: Can you tell me more about your 2022 Chardonnay?
  sentences:
  - The Jessup Cellars 2022 Chardonnay is a white wine that comes across as very well
    balanced due to the aging being done in a combination of 40% new American and
    60% neutral American Oak. This brings hints of oak to the wine while also offering
    a slightly creamy mouth feel without being a butter bomb. Our Napa Valley Chardonnay
    is a member favorite while the non-member price of $55 is appreciated by enthusiasts
    of this quality wine crafted by Rob Lloyd. The alcohol content is 14.8% while
    the PH is 3.4.
  - Jessup cellars and Tasting Gallery is located at 6740 Washinton St. at the North
    end of Yountville across from RH Yountville and North Block Restaurant. We are
    open from 10AM to 6PM 7 days a week and can be reached at 707.944.5620 for reservations

  - 'Table for Four is our celebrated and signature Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend
    and is anxiously anticipated by both guests and staff alike each year upon its
    release. Our 2019 vintage carries on the tradition of comprising a wine of distinction
    and depth, with layers of complexity to titillate any wine enthusiast.


    With notes of ripe black cherry and blackberry on the nose, the luscious fruit
    is accompanied by warm and inviting aromas of baking spice and dark cacao. An
    intriguing layer of subtle floral and herbal undertones enhances the complexity,
    with violet, anise, and a hint of spearmint adding nuance to this incredible profile.


    The palate sings with harmony as the fruit and spice components interplay, and
    fine, compact tannins give this wine the structural integrity to age for many
    years to come. With a lovely lingering finish, enjoy this wine now for a vibrant
    experience on the palate, or cellar it to increase its nuance in years to come.


    While Jessup Cellars Table for Four is comprised of the same 6 varietals as our
    Juel, the blend is very different being more Cab forward with 61.8% Cabernet,
    Sauvignon and 26.5% Cabernet Franc, expertly finished with 4.2% Petite Verdot,
    3.5% Petite Sirah, 2.7% Malbec and and a hint of Merlot at 1.1%.Like pur Juel
    the Table for Four is aged in 70% new French oak and matches the alcohol content
    at 14.9% as well as the PH at 3.65. The rice for non-members is $115.'
- source_sentence: What is the Solera method of dessert wine creation?
  sentences:
  - "Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a staple of most Napa Valley winemakers with\
    \ Jessup offering our 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon for 2024. As with most of our red\
    \ wines, our winemakers exercise 'The Art of the Blend' by starting with 90% Napa\
    \ Valley fruit from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County, then blend\
    \ in 5% Petite Sirah from the same AVA, 3% Merlot from our Truchard Vineyard in\
    \ the Los Carneros region, then finish it with 2.1% Cabernet Franc, which is the\
    \ parent grape of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, often used in blended wines.\
    \ Cabernet Franc originated in the Bordeaux region of France and to honor that\
    \ provenance, we age our 2019 Jessup Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon in 80% new French\
    \ oak for 22 months. Alcohol content in this varietal is14.9% with a PH of 3.65.\
    \ You can purchase our 2019 Cab for $90.\n\nThe palate of the wine matches the\
    \ aromatics providing juicy fruit flavors, rich tannins and a long finish.  This\
    \ wine drinks well now however will age gracefully for the next 5-8 years.  \n\
    \nEnjoy this Cabernet Sauvignon with a quality cut of beef or any dish that has\
    \ a nice smoky/fatty/or charred quality. "
  - 'The Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in
    the production of fortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira.
    Here''s how it works:

    Tiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged
    in a tiered system called a "solera stack." The bottom row contains the oldest
    wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively younger wines.

    Fractional Blending: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row
    of barrels for bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped
    up with wine from the row above. The process continues up the stack, with each
    barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with younger wine.

    Aging and Maturity: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year,
    a portion of the older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the
    complexity and depth of flavor. Over time, the younger wines gradually blend with
    and inherit characteristics from the older wines.

    Consistency: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the
    blend of wines remains relatively constant over time. Even though some wine is
    removed for bottling each year, the overall character of the solera remains consistent
    due to the blending of older and younger wines.

    Perpetual Process: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine
    continuously added at the top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling.
    This allows producers to maintain a consistent product while also ensuring that
    some of the original wine remains in the solera stack, sometimes for many years
    or even decades.

    Overall, the Solera method is a meticulous and time-honored process that results
    in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and aroma.'
